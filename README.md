# chorescence-docs
Design documents made for Chorescence, a chore management app developed using React.js, Node.js, and Postgres. \
Created for Software Engineering and Design Project classes at NYU Tandon.

Repo containing the frontend (written in React.js) can be found here: https://github.com/tg1625/chorescence-app \
Repo containing the backend (written in Node) is currently private due to containing the URI to the Heroku app, but I can create a public copy if requested. \
App hosted on Heroku can be found here: http:/chorescence.herokuapp.com/
