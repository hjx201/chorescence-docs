# chorescence-docs
Design documents made for Chorescence, a chore management app developed using React.js, Node.js, and Postgres. \
Created for Software Engineering and Design Project classes at NYU Tandon.

Repo containing the frontend (written in Node.js) can be found here: https://github.com/tg1625/chorescence-app \
Repo containing the backend is currently private due to containing the URI to the Heroku app, but I can create a public copy if requested.
